# AI-Image-to-Story Generator


#### AI Image-to-Story Generator — Multimodal Storytelling with Voice Narration
This project is a multimodal story-generation application that transforms user-uploaded images into fully structured narratives. The user begins by uploading one or more images and selecting a desired storytelling tone, such as moral, mystery, adventure, sci-fi, or fairy-tale. The application interprets the visual content in the images using advanced image understanding, extracts meaningful details, and uses them as the foundation for generating a coherent, engaging story. Instead of producing a generic narrative, the model tailors the storyline to the actual content of the images, ensuring that characters, objects, scenes, and emotions captured in the visuals play a direct role in the storytelling process.

#### Intelligent Story Tone Adaptation
The application adapts the final structure of the story based on the tone selected by the user. If the user chooses a moral tone, the app not only narrates the story but also concludes with a meaningful moral derived from the events in the narrative. If the user selects a mystery tone, the model constructs a suspenseful plot where clues from the uploaded images become part of the storyline, and it resolves the mystery at the end of the narrative. This dynamic tone-aware behavior ensures that each story feels purposeful and contextually aligned with the user's creative intent.

#### Multimodal Understanding
The core intelligence of the application comes from its ability to interpret images using a multimodal AI model. The system analyzes visual elements such as people, objects, locations, emotions, and interactions within the images. These detected attributes are then converted into story-building cues that the model uses to craft scenes, dialogues, conflicts, and resolutions. Because the story is grounded in real visual context, it feels more vivid and relatable than a generic AI-generated story.

#### Voice Narration
Beyond generating text, the application enhances the user experience by dictating the story aloud. A built-in text-to-speech module reads the story sentence by sentence, allowing users to listen to the narrative as if it were an audiobook. This feature makes the project suitable for children’s storytelling, accessibility use cases, creative writing assistance, or simply as an immersive story-listening experience. The combination of image understanding, dynamic story writing, and voice narration gives the application a polished, interactive feel.
